# Summary: Task 1.1.1 - Extend Existing Project Structure

**Date**: 2025-12-05
**Branch**: `feature/1.1.1-project-structure`
**Status**: Complete

## Overview

Extended the elixir-ontologies project with RDF dependencies and created the module structure required for Knowledge Graph tooling implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added (mix.exs)

```elixir
{:rdf, "~> 2.0"}
{:sparql, "~> 0.3", optional: true}
```

These bring in:
- RDF 2.1.0 - Core RDF library for graph operations
- SPARQL 0.3.11 - Query support (optional)
- Plus transitive dependencies: decimal, jason, jcs, nimble_csv, protocol_ex, sweet_xml, uniq

### 2. Directory Structure Created

```
lib/elixir_ontologies/
├── analyzer/    # Code analysis (AST parsing, extraction)
├── builders/    # RDF triple construction helpers
├── extractors/  # AST-to-RDF extraction logic
└── graph/       # Graph wrapper and CRUD operations
```

Each directory contains a `.gitkeep` file to ensure it's tracked by git.

### 3. Documentation Created

- `notes/features/1.1.1-project-structure.md` - Feature planning document
- `notes/planning/phase-01.md` - Updated with task completion markers

## Verification

- `mix deps.get` completed successfully
- `mix compile` exits with code 0
- All four directories exist and are properly structured

## Files Changed

1. `mix.exs` - Added RDF and SPARQL dependencies
2. `lib/elixir_ontologies/graph/.gitkeep` - New file
3. `lib/elixir_ontologies/analyzer/.gitkeep` - New file
4. `lib/elixir_ontologies/builders/.gitkeep` - New file
5. `lib/elixir_ontologies/extractors/.gitkeep` - New file
6. `notes/features/1.1.1-project-structure.md` - New file
7. `notes/planning/phase-01.md` - Updated task markers

## Next Steps

Task 1.1.2 (Configuration Structure) is next in Phase 1, which will create the Config module with settings for base IRI, output options, and feature flags.
